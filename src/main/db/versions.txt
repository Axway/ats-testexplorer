***     1        ***|   3.10.0-5    |  24-06-2016   |   ATS OFFICIAL RELEASE

        2           |   3.11.0      |  01-07-2016   |   Add tRunMetainfo and tScenarioMetainfo tables
                                                        Add sp_add_run_metainfo and sp_add_scenario_metainfo stored procedures

        3           |   3.11.0      |  16-08-2016   | Fixes for the last internal upgrade
                    |               |               | Major database re-factoring:
                                                           From now on Testcases are no more children Scenarios, but are children of Suites.
                                                           There is only one row in tScenarios for each scenario. A scenario is defined by its "fullName" which contains the java class package and the java method name.
                                                           tScenarios serves as a test code repository. When many executions of a scenario are made, we add a new row in tTestcases and nothing in tScenarios.

                                                           It is expected that the scenario meta info(in tScenarioMetainfo) is updated on each test execution so we keep this data up-to-date.
                                                           This is done by the Test harness listeners.

                                                           Stored procedures for Start/End of scenario are removed. All is done by Start/End of testcase.
                                                           Stored procedures for obtaining scenarios are left, as Test Explorer needs them. The test hierarchy in Test Explorer is not changed.

        5        ***|   4.0.0       |  30-03-2017   | ATS OFFICIAL RELEASE (First Open source release)
        5           |   4.0.1       |  31-03-2017   | No real change in db scripts from 4.0.0
        13          |   4.0.2       |  20-11-2017   | Adding PostgreSQL as a alternative database server.
                                                        Storing timestamp in UTC format in database and showing then in the browser according to the user locale
                                                        Combining testcase statistics in more than one chart
                                                        Since 4.0.0 and 4.0.1 are the same in case of db scripts, update to 4.0.2 can be done from both 4.0.0 and 4.0.1
        13          |   4.0.3       |  22-12-2017   | No real change in db scripts from 4.0.2
        13          |   4.0.4       |  01-03-2018   | No real change in db scripts from 4.0.3
        13          |   4.0.5       |  23-04-2018   | No real change in db scripts from 4.0.4.
		                                                DB: Compatible with SQL Server before version 2016
        11          |   4.x.x       |  xx-xx-2019   | DB: Technically supports many versions  >= 2008
		                                              Metainfo (key-value pairs) could be associated to testcase in addition to already supported run and scenario.





IMPORTANT:
  All upgrades do upgrade from the last official version. This means that for example internal version 2 and 3 will upgrade from internal version 1 which is the last official release.
  Internal version 3 will not upgrade from internal version 2

IMPORTANT: when changing the DB scripts, it is necessary to change:
 - TestExplorerDB.sql update the values of 'version', 'internalVersion' and 'initialVersion' in tInternal table
 - TestExplorerDB-Upgrade.sql update the value of 'internalVersion' in tInternal table

IMPORTANT:
  Use stars (***) around a version which is official released

P.S. Use blank space instead of tab, so table columns are respected properly in all editors(like Windows Notepad for example)
